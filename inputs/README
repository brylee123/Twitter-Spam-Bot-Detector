This folder contains input files to test your program.
You may modify these files or add your own - they are purely for debugging.

Each JSON file contains a dictionary with input parameters to your program.
For example:
    {
        "log_path": "/home/candidate/candidate_files/py/inputs/small.log"
    }

To test your program using the JSON file run:
    python test_answer.py ./inputs/small.json

This calls identify_spammers() in answer.py as follows:
    identify_spammers(log_path)
