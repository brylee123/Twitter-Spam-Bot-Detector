STRUCTURE OF EACH LOG LINE

  Each line is a json object describing an event. An event contains a set of
  fields, some of which are common to all events. You may assume that there
  are no malformed events and that there are no missing fields.


EXPLANATION OF COMMON FIELDS

    user: Username to which the event applies
    action: Name of the event, all lowercase
    timestamp: Integer representing the Unix time in milliseconds. For example, 1484849167761 is one millisecond after 1484849167760.


EVENT LIST

    follow: a user follows another user.
    unfollow: a user unfollows another user.
    tweet: a user sends out a public message. It can be a reply to another tweet.
    retweet: a user shares someone's tweet.
    like: a user likes a tweet. A retweet cannot be liked.


FIELDS FOR FOLLOW

    target: Username of the user being followed

NOTES

    Events are ordered by increasing timestamp.
    Each username uniquely identifies the user.
    A user can retweet a tweet by someone that they do not follow.
    A user can reply to a tweet by someone that they do not follow.
    A user will not follow someone that they already follow.
    A user will not follow itself.
    There are no events with the same timestamp.
    Tweet ids are not sequential nor ascending.
    Tweet ids are below 2^64.
